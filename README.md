# Phonebook

**Description:**
Create a simple command-line contact management system in C that allows users to store and manage their contacts. Each contact can have a name, phone number, and email address. Users should be able to add new contacts, view existing contacts, update contact information, and delete contacts.

**Features:**
1. **Add Contact:** Users can add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. The contact details should be stored in a data structure like an array.

2. **View Contacts:** Users can view a list of all their contacts, including their names and phone numbers.

3. **Search Contacts:** Users can search for a contact by name and view their full contact information.

4. **Update Contact:** Users can update the phone number and email address of an existing contact.

5. **Delete Contact:** Users can delete a contact by entering their name.

6. **Save to File:** Implement the ability to save the contact data to a text file so that it can be loaded again when the program is restarted.

7. **Load from File:** Implement the ability to load previously saved contacts from a text file when the program starts.

**Tips:**
- Use a structure to represent a contact, containing fields for name, phone number, and email address.
- Create an array or linked list to store multiple contacts.
- Implement a user-friendly menu system for interacting with the program.
- Use file I/O functions to save and load contacts from a text file.
- Implement error handling to deal with scenarios like duplicate contacts or contact not found.

This project will help you practice data structures, file handling, and user input processing in C. It's a practical project that can be expanded upon by adding more features and improving the user interface.
